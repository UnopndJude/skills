## Git Commit Message Convention

**ALWAYS follow the commit message convention when making commits.**

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Type (Required)
Must be one of:
- **feat**: A new skill or feature addition

- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process, dependencies, or configuration files

### Scope (Required)
Must be the **skill name** (e.g., `calculator`, `weather`, `translator`). This identifies which skill the commit affects.

### Subject (Required)
- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" nor "adds"
- Don't capitalize the first letter

- Maximum 72 characters

### Examples
